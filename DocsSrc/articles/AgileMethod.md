Scrum: 

Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
A “process framework” is a particular set of practices that must be followed in order for a process to be consistent with the framework. (For example, the Scrum process framework requires the use of development cycles called Sprints, the XP framework requires pair programming, and so forth.)
“Lightweight” means that the overhead of the process is kept as small as possible, to maximize the amount of productive time available for getting useful work done.
A Scrum process is distinguished from other agile processes by specific concepts and practices, divided into the three categories of Roles, Artifacts, and Time Boxes. These and other terms used in Scrum are defined below. Scrum is most often used to manage complex software and product development, using iterative and incremental practices. Scrum significantly increases productivity and reduces time to benefits relative to classic “waterfall” processes. 

Increase the quality of the deliverables
Cope better with change (and expect the changes)
Provide better estimates while spending less time creating them
Be more in control of the project schedule and state

XP: 

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team. XP is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development.


Devops: 

DevOps is a mindset, a culture, and a set of technical practices. It provides communication, integration, automation, and close cooperation among all the people needed to plan, develop, test, deploy, release, and maintain a Solution.

DevOps is a combination of two words, development and operations. Without a DevOps approach, there’s often significant tension between those who create new features and those who maintain the stability of the production environment. The development team is measured on the business value they deliver to end users, while IT service management is measured on the health and stability of the production environment.

Kanban: 

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.
