# HTTP version 2

Write a description of what is new in HTTP version 2?

At a high level, HTTP/2:

is binary, instead of textual
is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
can therefore use one connection for parallelism
uses header compression to reduce overhead
allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches
